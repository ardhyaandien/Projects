# Projects
Codes from projects that I have done:
- Bike Seoul & Washington: Focused on data wrangling and data visualisation
- Boostrapping: Code for bootsrapping and Monte Carlo simulation (needs parallel computation to be implemented to make the code run faster)
- ID5059_models: Code includes data cleaning and data evaluation through python in jupyter notebooks 
- Maximisation: A code used to test a function 
- my_rnorm: Create mathematical functions rnorm, rchisq and rt in r.
